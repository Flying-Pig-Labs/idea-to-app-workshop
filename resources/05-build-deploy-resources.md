## ðŸŽ¯ Pro Tips from the Trenches:

1. **Stack these for maximum power:** Vercel/Cloudflare Pages (frontend) + Supabase (backend) + GitHub Actions (CI/CD) = Full production app for $0
2. **Monitoring matters:** Add Sentry's free tier (5K errors/month) early. You'll thank yourself later.
3. **Domain hack:** Use Cloudflare for DNS even if hosting elsewhere. Their free tier is unbeatable.
4. **Sleep mode workaround:** For Render and similar platforms, use UptimeRobot (also free) to ping your services every 5 minutes.
5. **Learn the limits:** Every free tier has them. Know them before you architect your solution.

Remember: These aren't "toy" solutions. Companies have scaled to millions of users on these platforms. The only difference between you and them? They started building instead of overthinking it.
