## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips From The Trenches:

1. **Always cache responses** - It's literally free performance and cost reduction
2. **Start with smaller models** - GPT-3.5 or Claude Haiku often work fine for 80% of tasks
3. **Test everything with PromptFoo** - Better to catch prompt regressions in testing than in production
4. **Join the communities** - The Discord servers for these tools are goldmines of free advice
5. **Document your prompts** - Future you will thank present you when debugging at 2 AM

Remember: The best prompt is the one that works, costs the least, and doesn't wake you up at night with production alerts. Everything else is just fancy academic talk.

Now go forth and prompt engineer like your startup depends on it - because it probably does! ðŸš€
