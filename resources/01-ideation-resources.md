## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip Trifecta:
- **Scrappy**: "Use Reddit to find problems, Google Trends to size them, and Indie Hackers to see who's solving them"
- **Dev**: "Automate everything with PyTrends, validate with real humans on Product Hunt, iterate based on data"
- **Adult**: "Sequential validation: Problem validation â†’ Market sizing â†’ Solution testing â†’ Revenue model verification"

Remember: These tools are free, but your time isn't. Pick 2-3 and go DEEP rather than trying all 8 superficially. The best validation is someone asking "when can I buy this?" - everything else is just expensive guessing.
