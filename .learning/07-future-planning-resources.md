### The Evolution Path
```
MVP Tonight â†’ Week 1 Goals â†’ Month 1 Milestone â†’ v1.0 Vision
      â†“            â†“               â†“                  â†“
   Validate      Iterate        Scale Up          Sustainable
```

### The Now/Next/Later Framework Explained

**NOW (This Week) - Focus on Validation**
- Get 10-50 real users (start with people you know)
- Collect qualitative feedback (what do they actually say?)
- Fix only critical bugs (don't add features yet)
- Track core metrics (signups, usage, feedback)

Key Questions:
- Who are your first 10 users specifically?
- How will you reach them tomorrow?
- What single metric matters most?

**NEXT (Weeks 2-4) - Focus on Iteration**
- Implement top user requests (based on data, not guesses)
- Improve conversion rates (where do users drop off?)
- Add essential features only (resist feature creep)
- Begin content/SEO strategy (compound growth)

Prioritization Criteria:
- User pain point severity (how much does it hurt?)
- Implementation effort (hours not weeks)
- Business impact (moves your key metric)
- Technical debt (fix foundations early)

**LATER (Months 2-3) - Focus on Scale**
- Advanced features (now you know what users want)
- Monetization strategy (proven value first)
- Team building (when you can't do it alone)
- Automation/efficiency (scale without burning out)

Vision Elements:
- Revenue goals (specific numbers)
- User milestones (growth trajectory)
- Market position (your unique space)
- Team structure (who you'll need)

## ðŸ“Š Impact/Effort Matrix Theory

### How to Use the Matrix
```
High Impact, Low Effort (DO FIRST)
â”œâ”€â”€ Quick wins that move metrics
â”œâ”€â”€ User experience improvements
â””â”€â”€ Bug fixes affecting many users

High Impact, High Effort (PLAN FOR)
â”œâ”€â”€ Core feature additions
â”œâ”€â”€ Infrastructure improvements
â””â”€â”€ Major integrations

Low Impact, Low Effort (MAYBE)
â”œâ”€â”€ Nice-to-haves
â”œâ”€â”€ Polish features
â””â”€â”€ Edge case fixes

Low Impact, High Effort (AVOID)
â”œâ”€â”€ Complex features few want
â”œâ”€â”€ Premature optimization
â””â”€â”€ Vanity features
```
