## üí° Golden Rule

"If you can envision it clearly in your prompt, Lovable can build it!"

## üé® Example Prompts for Brainstorming (ChatGPT)

- "Quiz me on the key components of effective AI prompts. What's the difference between context, instructions, examples, and constraints?"
- "Here's my audio brainstorm about my app idea: [paste transcript]. Help me transform this into a structured prompt for Lovable.dev with clear sections for design, functionality, and user experience."
- "Analyze the prompts used by successful AI-generated websites. What patterns make them effective? Show me 3 examples with breakdowns."
- "Challenge my MVP prompt - is it too complex? Help me identify features to remove for v1 and save for v2. Focus on the core value proposition."
- "Generate 5 variations of my app prompt, each emphasizing a different user benefit. Help me A/B test which angle resonates most."

## üéØ Example Prompt for Execution (Lovable.dev)

Include email signup for beta access that posts to [webhook URL]. Add 3 feature cards: Guided Meditations (with audio icon), Mood Tracking (with chart icon), Daily Reminders (with bell icon). Include testimonial section with placeholder quotes. Footer with privacy policy and terms. Mobile-responsive with smooth animations. Use Inter font and soft shadows for modern, approachable feel."
