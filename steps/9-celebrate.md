## 🎯 Final Thoughts

<details>
<summary><b>📝 Letter from your Instructors</b></summary>

Congratulations, builder.

Tonight, you did something 99% of people never do - you shipped. You took an idea trapped in your head and made it real. That's powerful.

But here's the secret: The app isn't the real victory. The real win is discovering you can build anything. You've unlocked a superpower. You fucking rock!

Some of you will turn tonight's project into thriving businesses. Others will use these skills to build different dreams. Both paths are victories.

Whatever you do next, remember this feeling. Remember that building is just a series of small, concrete steps. You've proven you can take them.

Keep shipping,
Ford & Luke

P.S. - Tag me when you hit a million users!
