## ✈️ Part I: Preflight Check

Quick sweep before launch:

👁️ **Visually scan the site** — layout, branding, and CTAs should all look right

📝 **Submit the form with test data** — confirm success message, no glitches

🔄 **If you added backend logic** (e.g. Zapier), verify test data flowed through

📱 **Check the mobile view** for readability and tap targets

🧽 **Clear out any leftover dummy content** from Lovable

**1–2 minutes max.** Capture any fixes and jump to the next step.
