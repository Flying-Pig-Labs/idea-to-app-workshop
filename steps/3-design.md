## 🎨 Part I: Define Visual Style

> **⏰ Time:** 5 minutes  
> **🎯 Goal:** Create a clear design direction for your site

### 🎭 Brand Personality (2 min)

![Tool](https://img.shields.io/badge/🛠️_Tool-GPT--4-purple?style=flat-square)

**Brand Refinement Guide:**

### Key Considerations Before You Start:
- **Your brand is a promise** - It's not just colors and fonts, but how you make people feel
- **Consistency builds trust** - Mixed messages confuse visitors and hurt conversions
- **Know your audience deeply** - Your brand should resonate with their values and pain points
- **Differentiation is crucial** - Standing out matters more than fitting in
- **Test your assumptions** - What you think works might differ from what actually converts

### GPT Brand Refinement Prompt Template:

<details>
<summary><b>📝 Copy This Prompt for GPT-4</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```
I want you to act as a brand strategist and help me refine my brand identity through an interactive quiz. Here's my business context:

Business: [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]
Description: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU DO]
Target Audience: [WHO YOUR IDEAL CUSTOMERS ARE]

Please guide me through a brand refinement exercise by:

1. Ask me 5-7 strategic questions about my brand, one at a time. Questions should explore:
   - Emotional connection with my audience
   - Differentiation from competitors
   - Brand personality traits
   - Visual preferences and associations
   - Success metrics and goals

2. After each answer, provide brief feedback and ask a follow-up question that digs deeper.

3. Once complete, synthesize my responses into:
   - A brand positioning statement
   - 3 core brand values with explanations
   - Personality attributes (professional/playful, modern/classic, etc.)
   - Visual direction recommendations (energy level, color psychology, typography style)
   - 3 specific ways to differentiate from competitors

4. Finally, create a "Brand Personality Snapshot" I can use for design decisions:
   - Target Feeling: [How visitors should feel]
   - Visual Energy: [Overall vibe and intensity]
   - Market Position: [How you compare to others]
   - Key Differentiators: [What makes you unique]

Start with the first question and let's refine my brand together.
