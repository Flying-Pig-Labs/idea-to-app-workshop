3. **Include personality** - Apps with character get better engagement
4. **Technical requirements** - Must be explicit about data flow

### Common Participant Questions:
- "How long should my prompt be?" ‚Üí "As long as needed to be clear, typically 200-400 words"
- "Can I change it later?" ‚Üí "Yes, iteration is part of the process"
- "What if it doesn't work?" ‚Üí "We'll debug together in Step 5"
- "Should I include design details?" ‚Üí "Yes, but describe the feeling, not pixels"

### Transition Script to Step 5:
```
"Your prompts are polished and powerful! You've essentially written 
the blueprint for your AI developer. In the next session, we'll 
paste these prompts into Lovable and watch your applications come 
to life. Get ready to see magic happen!"
```

### Pre-Build Checklist:
- [ ] All participants have completed prompts
- [ ] Webhook URLs are correctly included

- Number of peer review suggestions implemented
- Energy level on scale of 1-10 (target: 8+)

**Quality Check Questions:**
- Can you understand the app idea in 30 seconds?
- Are technical requirements clear?
- Does personality come through?
- Is scope appropriate for 10-minute build?

**Golden Rule for Facilitators:**
"Guide them to clarity, not perfection. A clear, simple prompt beats a complex, perfect one every time."
