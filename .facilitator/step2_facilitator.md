## 🎬 Facilitator Actions & Scripts

### Opening Script
```
"I'm Ford, and we're about to make your ideas visual! In the next 15 minutes, 
you'll sketch out exactly how users will interact with your MVP. 
No artistic skills needed - we're going for clarity, not beauty. 
Let's turn your validated idea into a blueprint for building!"
```

### Phase 1: Core Flow Prompt (3 minutes)
*Facilitator Prompt:*
"Draw three rectangles: Landing → Action → Success. 
What's the ONE thing users do?"

### Phase 2: Add Key Details (3 minutes)
*Facilitator Action:*
- Share screen with example
- Call out good patterns seen
- Remind about data collection

### Handoff Script
```
"Beautiful work! You've transformed ideas into visual blueprints. 
Now we need to build the backend infrastructure to capture those 
valuable user emails. Our next session will set up your data 
pipeline with Google Sheets and Zapier - the foundation of your MVP!"
```

## 💡 Facilitation Tips

### Visual Thinking Helpers

| Challenge | Quick Fix | Visual Aid |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Overwhelmed by blank canvas | Start with 3 boxes | Show template |
| Too detailed | "Zoom out" reminder | High-level example |
| Not visual thinker | Use words first, shapes later | Text-based flow |
| Perfectionism | "Messy is fine!" | Show rough example |

### Energy Management
- Play upbeat background music during sketching
- Walk around room, offer encouragement
- Celebrate creative solutions publicly
- Keep time pressure positive, not stressful

### Inclusion Strategies
- Offer pre-drawn templates for common patterns
- Partner visual thinkers with verbal processors
- Allow text-heavy flows if that works better
- Emphasize function over form

## ⏱️ Time Management
- **Running behind:** Skip peer review, go to export
- **Too fast:** Add mobile vs desktop versions
- **Mixed pace:** Have fast finishers help others
- Can extend by 2 minutes if group is engaged
- Never cut sketching time below 6 minutes
- Peer review is optional if running late

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Technical Issues
- **tldraw not loading:** Use whiteboard/paper, photo later
- **Can't share screen:** Use phone to show sketch
- **Browser issues:** Try incognito mode or different browser

### Design Blocks
- **Too many features:** Force ranking - pick top 3
- **Can't visualize:** Start with competitor example
- **Analysis paralysis:** Set 2-minute timer per section
