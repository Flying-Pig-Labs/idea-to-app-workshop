## 💡 Facilitation Tips

### Pacing Strategies
- Have participants follow along live
- Pause after each major step
- Use "raise hand when ready" checks
- Keep energy up with success celebrations

### Support Strategies
- Pair technical with non-technical
- Have TAs circulate during setup
- Screen share for visual learners
- Provide written steps as backup

## 🎓 Energy Management
- This is the most technical step
- Celebrate each successful test
- Keep momentum with progress checks
- Use success sounds/reactions

## 🕐 Time Management

### Time Flexibility
- Can compress Sheet setup (2 min)
- Cannot skip webhook generation
- Testing can be done async if needed
- Keep moving even if some struggle

### Key Messages
- "You're building real infrastructure"
- "This scales to thousands of users"
- "Same tools used by funded startups"
- "No servers or deployment needed"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Setup Issues

| Issue | Quick Fix | Prevention |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Zapier login fails | Use facilitator account | Have backup account |
| Sheet permissions | Make sure it's not private | Check sharing settings |
| Webhook not catching | Check URL copying | Triple-check URL |
| Mapping confusion | Show visual diagram | Use clear labels |

### Zapier Issues
**Problem:** Webhook not generating
- Solution: Check account limits
- Backup: Use facilitator's webhook temporarily

**Problem:** Cannot connect Google account
- Solution: Check popup blockers
- Backup: Use incognito mode

**Problem:** Zap won't turn on
- Solution: Complete all required fields
- Backup: Clone from template

### Google Sheets Issues
**Problem:** Permission denied
- Solution: Check if using work account
- Backup: Create with personal account

**Problem:** Cannot see data
- Solution: Refresh sheet
- Backup: Check Zapier task history

### Testing Issues
**Problem:** No data flowing
- Check: Correct webhook URL?
- Check: Zap turned on?
- Check: Correct field mapping?

## 📋 Facilitator Actions & Demos

### Google Sheets Demo
- Share screen showing column setup
- Explain each field's purpose
- Show example entries

### Critical Demo Points
1. Show the webhook URL generation process clearly
2. Demonstrate the field mapping visually
3. Run a live test and show data appearing in Sheet
4. Celebrate when data flows successfully

## 🎬 Opening Script
```
"Now we build the engine that powers your MVP! While your frontend will be beautiful, 
it needs somewhere to send the data. We're creating a professional-grade backend 
using no-code tools that scales with your idea. This is the same architecture 
many startups use before building custom solutions."
```

## 🔄 Transition Script
```
"Incredible! You now have a production-ready backend. Your webhook URL 
is like having your own API endpoint. Next, we'll craft the perfect 
prompt for Lovable that includes this webhook, turning your sketch 
into a real application that captures real user data!"
```

## 📊 Success Checkpoints

### Quality Assurance
- Verify all participants have unique webhooks
- Confirm sheets are receiving test data
- Ensure webhook URLs are saved
- Check understanding with quick poll

### Emergency Protocols
- Have backup Zapier account ready
- Pre-created template Zaps to clone
- Alternative webhook services bookmarked
- Manual data entry as last resort
