# Step 1: Ideation & Validation - Facilitator Guide

## Pre-Workshop Preparation (For Facilitators)

### Account Setup (10 min setup time)
1. **Account Setup**
   - Create IdeaBrowser demo account with Pro features
   - Prepare 3-5 example validated ideas from different industries
   - Test AI Research Agent with sample queries

2. **Materials Preparation**
   - Print IdeaFactory handouts (1 per participant)
   - Prepare digital slides with framework overview
   - Queue up live demo scenarios

## Facilitation Tips

### Common Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution | Time Impact |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Analysis paralysis | Set 2-minute timer per idea | None |
| Idea too complex | Focus on ONE core feature | -2 min |
| Can't find good fit | Use AI Research Agent | +3 min |
| Technical questions | Defer to Step 5 (Build) | None |

### Inclusion Strategies
- Pair up non-technical with technical participants
- Offer pre-selected "starter ideas" for those struggling
- Emphasize that all ideas are valid - execution matters

## Energy Management
- Keep pace brisk - this sets tone for entire workshop
- Use timer alerts for transitions
- Celebrate "aha moments" when participants find good fits

## Facilitator Actions During Session

### Opening (5 minutes)
**Luke's Introduction Script:**
```
"Welcome to 'Idea to App in One Night'! I'm Luke, and over the next 30 minutes, 
we're going to transform your raw ideas into validated business opportunities. 
By the end of this session, you'll have a researched, market-validated concept 
ready to build tonight."
```

### During Hands-On Validation (12 minutes)
- Circulate and assist with navigation
- Answer questions about validation metrics
- Help refine ideas to MVP scope

### Transition Script
**Handoff Script:**
```
"Excellent work! You've all validated real problems worth solving. 
Now let's hand over to Ford, who will help you visualize your solution 
before we build. Ford will guide you through sketching user flows and 
mapping out your MVP's core experience."
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technical Issues
- **IdeaBrowser down:** Use backup slides with pre-researched ideas
- **Slow internet:** Have offline validation worksheet ready
- **Account issues:** Share screen from facilitator account

### Participant Issues
- **Stuck on idea selection:** Provide curated list of 5 proven concepts
- **Overthinking validation:** Remind that tonight is for learning, not perfection
- **Want to pivot mid-session:** Allow it - better now than during build

## Time Management

**Time Buffers:**
- Have 5-minute overflow plan if running behind
- Can compress sharing section to 1 minute if needed
- Never skip validation - it's core to workshop success

## Facilitator Notes

**Energy Checkpoint:**
- This session sets workshop tone
- High energy and enthusiasm crucial
- Celebrate every validated idea

**Key Message:**
"You're not just building an app tonight - you're solving a real problem for real people."

## Support Strategies

### For Different Experience Levels
- **Beginners:** Focus on problem identification, provide more guided examples
- **Experienced:** Challenge them to find unique angles, push for deeper validation
- **Mixed groups:** Use pairing to balance experience levels

### Managing Questions
- Keep a "parking lot" for technical questions to address in Step 5
- For complex business model questions, remind them we're focusing on MVP
- Encourage peer-to-peer help during hands-on time

### Critical Warnings
- **The Blank Mirror Problem:** If target audience doesn't communicate online, AI data may mislead
- Remind participants that validation is directional, not definitive
- Tonight is for learning and experimentation, not launching a business
