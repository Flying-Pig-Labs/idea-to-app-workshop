## üìù Facilitator Script Snippets

### Opening the Closing:
"Let's take a moment to recognize what just happened. In one evening, you transformed from someone with an idea to someone with a LIVE APP serving REAL USERS. You've joined an elite group who ship, not just dream. Let's celebrate each success!"

### Transitioning to Resources:
"Success doesn't end tonight - it begins. Let me show you the support system waiting for you..."

### Final Send-off:
"You came as dreamers, you leave as builders. Your app might become the next big thing, or it might teach you lessons for your next build. Either way, you've crossed the chasm from idea to execution. Keep shipping, keep learning, keep building. The world needs what you're creating!"

- Call on specific individuals kindly
- Share your own example first
